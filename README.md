# CLASSPROJECT REPOSITORY

***

This project is about a analisy of the palmerpenguins dataset online. Where I had to   select two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are in different forms of apresention.

This project was developed to demonstrate my abilities to code in Python and analyze this database (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) using Python and VSC in different methods, after the guidance given during the last 3 months in the PRINCIPLES OF DATA ANALYTICS class.
