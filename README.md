# CLASSPROJECT REPOSITORY 
*** 

This project is about an analysis of the Palmer penguin's dataset online.  

Where I had to select two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are in different forms of presentation. 

  

This project was developed to demonstrate my abilities to code in Python and analyze this database (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) using Python and VSC in different methods, after the guidance given during the last 3 months in the PRINCIPLES OF DATA ANALYTICS class. 

  

Get Started 

For you access this project you will need to use python 3.11, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

I was a nurse for the last 23y, after the covid and my son I decided to change my career to IT, and I started studying IT last year. I never thought I would be doing what I am doing now.
